    description: `The Grotto is a nautical-themed immersive Airbnb experience in Miami, built around a converted boat and cavern retreat. The goal was to elevate the listing beyond a standard short-term rental by creating a cohesive, premium brand experience that communicates the magic of the space.

I led creative direction and execution across the physical space, digital presence, and guest experience. For the space itself, I styled and staged the interior, creating themed side tables, installing flowing curtains to frame the grotto entrance, and curating a nautical history wall above the sitting area. I then photographed the finished space for use across all deliverables.

For the website, I developed the brand voice and wrote all copy, establishing a warm, voyager-inspired narrative that guides visitors through the space as if they're already on board. I also contributed to the UI design, ensuring the visual presentation matched the immersive tone of the writing.

Lastly, the Captain's Handbook is a premium digital guest guide accessible via QR code during the stay. Structured like a ship's log across seven chapters, it covers everything from arrival instructions and space-by-space guidance to contrast therapy protocols and curated local recommendations, turning a functional necessity into an extension of the brand experience.`,

The conception of Skram came from my own personal experience with scarring, paired with a deep dive into beauty industry research and trends to identify whitespace opportunities.

To validate demand, I conducted primary research through a consumer survey with 1,000+ participants of all genders and ages, as well as an expert interview with renowned dermatologist Dr. Nelson Novick. The research confirmed consumer need for scar solutions across different skin and scar types.

From there, I developed cohesive branding aligned with an inclusive mission and brought four research-backed hero products to life. I collaborated with Rose Sparacio, a clinical research and claims advisor, to develop efficacious ingredient formulations tailored to each scar type.

Throughout the final execution of skram, I led a cross-functional team spanning industrial design, graphic design, social strategy, photography, and film to bring the brand to life.`,
